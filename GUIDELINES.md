## General notes

* Permission is granted to use the images supplied alongside this document to identify, critique and associate information with the racetime.gg website, racetime.gg limited and its related concerns.
* The images in this archive may not be re-used for other purposes, unless those purposes fall under lawful fair use under English copyright law.
* Do not alter the images provided except where such alterations are allowed under the below guidelines. In particular, do **not** overlap the images with any other content.

## Naming

The website's full name is **racetime.gg**. This should not be shortened to "racetime" or similar. The name is *always* given in full lowercase.

The alternative form **racetimeGG** is sometimes used on social media and other places where the full site name cannot be used. This format is acceptable if technical limitations prevent the use of the proper site name.

The abbreviation **rt.gg** can also be used when referencing the site in shorthand. This should *only* be used if you have identified the site by its full name elsewhere. As with the full site name, do not use any capital letters.

racetime.gg is a property of **racetime.gg limited**, a registered company. Registered company names in England & Wales do not specify any capitalisation, but for stylistic purposes the company name should be rendered in all lowercase, just like the site name.

### Summary

The following names are recommended:
* racetime.gg
* racetimeGG
* rt.gg
* racetime.gg limited (when referring to the company)

## Logos and icons

The following brand assets are provided in this archive:
* full-logo
* icon
* icon-rounded
* favicon

For each asset, you'll find a fully scalable SVG copy along with several pre-rendered PNG images. You can use, convert and resize these as needed.

### full-logo

This image includes the racetime.gg icon and the name of the site in its standard title font (Roboto Slab).

You **may** crop this image's borders to fit better in place. Do not apply rounded corners, or crop out visible elements of the logo (i.e. the icon or the "racetime.gg" text).

### icon

This image includes only the racetime.gg icon, with no text or other decoration.

Cropping/Altering the icon is *not* recommended. Do not apply rounded corners (use icon-rounded instead).

### icon-rounded

This image is the same as the standard icon, but the background is circular instead of square.

As with the standard icon, do not crop or alter this image.

### favicon

This image shows just the stopwatch part of the icon. It is designed for low-resolution renders, like a favicon, or anywhere else that a smaller image is called for.

In addition to the standard SVG/PNG formats, an ICO version of this file is also available in this archive.

The favicon **may**:
  * be placed on a solid black background, or
  * given a solid black fill

when used on a lighter background, if necessary.

## Fonts

racetime.gg uses **Roboto Slab** for the logo's title font. Body text is typically rendered using **Roboto**. Both of these fonts are freely available from Google Fonts, and so they are not included in this archive.
